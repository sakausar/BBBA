The first game I ever created using only eclipse

To play, download files and launch an IDE (perferablly eclipse). The main function is found in the folder "Main" in the class "Game.java"

Be sure that both the "src" and "Resources" files are changed into packages to allow the program to run. 

All controls are listed in the game itself

Expect some bugs due to the transfering of code from an older IDE to a newer one.
